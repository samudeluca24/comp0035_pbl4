# COMP0035 PBL 4 and 5: Data preparation and exploration

## Data

The data in the activities is from the following sources:

- [London 2012 Ticket Sales](https://data.london.gov.uk/download/london-2012-ticket-sales/4711eb39-cb56-4f47-804d-e486dae89a1d/assembly-london-2012-ticket-sales.xls)
- [Paralympic medals and event info](https://www.paralympic.org/london-2012/results/medalstandings)

The data has been modified such that it can be used for a data cleaning activity.

You can either use your own dataset for this or [paralympics_raw.csv](data/paralympics_raw.csv) from the directory. If
using your own then place a copy in the `/data` directory of the project.

There is a nice example on Kaggle with a more extensive Olympics' data
set ([Exploring 120 years of Olympic history](https://www.kaggle.com/snocco/exploring-120-years-of-olympics-history/notebook))
where the author, Stefano Nocco, walks through the preparation activities. If you want to access it you will need to
create a Kaggle account so please be sure that you are happy with their terms and conditions before you proceed.
